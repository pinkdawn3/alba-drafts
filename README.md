# Hello, I'm Alba!

Welcome to my portfolio! This is where I keep all the cool stuff I've been building while practicing web development.

**[Wanna see it live?](https://pinkdawn3.github.io/alba-drafts/)**

## Why did I make this?

I built this site to showcase what I can do with modern web tech. It's got a few different projects that show off different skills, from managing state to writing tests to making things work in multiple languages.

The whole site is responsive, designed to be used in PCs, tablets and mobiles phones. And because I'm still a translator at heart I offer multilingual support for both English and Spanish.

## The Projects

### Shop

A fake online shop where you can browse products and add them to a cart.

**What it does:**

- Browse a product gallery
- Add/remove stuff from your cart

Being the first of the projects, this one served to refresh all the things I knew about React, as well as practicing **useState** and **useContext** for managing the shopping cart state across components.

### Task Manager

If you're like me and can't keep track of all the things you want to do. Also, Kanban boards are so cool.

**What it does:**

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Set priorities and deadlines
- Mark things as done

I built this to practice **useReducer** and get better at testing with **Vitest**. Also learned a ton about making responsive layouts that actually work well on phones.

### Book Tracker _(currently building this!)_

Track what you're reading, want to read, and have finished.

**What it'll do:**

- Search real books using Google Books API
- Track your reading progress
- Organize books into shelves

Learning **React Query** with this one, plus getting comfortable working with external APIs.

## Built with

- **React** + **TypeScript** - because types are your friend
- **Vite** - fast and simple
- **Tailwind CSS** - for styling
- **Vitest** - making sure things actually work
- **React Router** - getting around the site
- **Lingui** - bilingual support (English/Spanish)

### Other stuff

- **Flowbite** + **HeadlessUI** - components for Tailwind
- **hello-pangea/dnd** - for drag and drop
- **FontAwesome** - for icons

## How to run it yourself?

```bash
# Grab the code
git clone https://github.com/pinkdawn3/alba-drafts.git
cd portfolio

# Install stuff
npm install

# Run it
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Running tests

```bash
npm run test
```

or

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

## What I learned building this

- State management patterns (useState, useContext, useReducer)
- Writing actual tests
- Internationalization
- TypeScript
- Making sure things look good on mobile
- Component patterns and keeping code clean

## What's next?

- Finish the Book Tracker
- Maybe add some animations
- Build another project
- Keep learning and improving!
