# Alba's Drafts

I made this project to show what I'm capable of.

The website uses the following tech stack:

- React & Vite with Typescript
- Vitest with Jsdom for Testing

Other libraries include:

- Tailwind
- React Router
- Fontawesome
- useLocalStorage
- lingui

To run the project, clone the repo and run:

```js
npm run dev
```
